Welcome to voxelgame.com, Voxel Game is an early concept voxel game engine at an alpha testing stage. The engine currently does not include any gameplay, however the plan for the future is to incorporate a number of different gameplay ideas. Where we plan to be a bit different then most voxel games is that this wont be for infinite exploring and digging, but more in the direction of pvp and co-op tower defense type of games in a fully changeable voxel world.

Voxel Game has been written in C#, and currently works on Windows with .Net Framework 4, and Linux with Mono 2.10+, I have not tested on MacOSX but it should work too. 

**To build it with MonoDevelop 3.0 you must load Blox/Blox.sln because main one it is for VisualStudio 2012 which MonoDevelop does not seem to support.
